# cart1

This project is a simple shopping cart, which has the possibility to create, edit or delete the elements that they're displayed. Although quite simple, the main goal was to implement certain contents that I didn't understand pretty well at the moment, such as global state management and React Router implementation. 

The app has been built using MERN stack, for global state management zustand was used. The site is functioning and you could visit it by following [this link](https://cart1-x7tq.onrender.com/).
